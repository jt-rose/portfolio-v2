        For most of the last decade I've worked as a project manager at a market
        research firm, where uncovering and analyzing large collections of data
        was an essential part of my role. This gradually led me to an interest
        in automation and business intelligence, both of which started me down
        the path of programming.
        <br />
        <br />
        What started off as building simple terminal games in Python eventually
        grew into an interest in web development, where I started to experiment
        with building some (at the time, very ugly) websites and first wrapping
        my head around JavaScript and JQuery. Since then, I've gone on to learn
        React, TypeScript, Node, SQL, Docker, GraphQL, and recently Golang.
        <br />
        <br />
        I enjoy exploring the React ecosystem as well as improving my backend
        skills by building new GraphQL servers. I'm excited by all the
        advancements that have swept through web development over the last few
        years and hope I can contribute to a small part of it.
        <br />
        <br />
        When I'm not fighting the computer, I enjoy spending time with my young
        boys, gaming, and reading Japanese novels.
