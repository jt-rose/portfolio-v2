      <h3>Full Stack Web Developer</h3>
      <p>
        Hello and welcome to my site! I am a fullstack developer focusing on
        TypeScript, React, NextJS, and GraphQL. I'm a functional programming
        enthusiast and have recently begun exploring Golang and Rust as well.
        When I'm not busy with my boys, I can usually be found digging into a
        new library or building out another side project. If you'd like to work
        together please reach out! Happy Coding!
